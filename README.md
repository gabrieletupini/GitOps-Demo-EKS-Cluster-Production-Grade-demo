This project showcases the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests and deploys a containerized microservice application to an AWS EKS cluster with the use of Jenkins and ArgoCD.

All of the infrastructure is deployed to AWS using Terraform and the state is kept in an S3 bucket. The pipeline builds, tests and deploys container images to ECR when a new pull request is made to the respective GitHub repository of a given microservice. The app itself is deployed using ArgoCD which will constantly update the cluster based on the manifest files and helm charts of a given GitHub repository. EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana) are used to provide centralized logging. Prometheus is used for showcasing the implementation of monitoring and alerting.

This is an on-going personal project and is still a WIP. For more in depth instructions about how to use the demo please head over to this public Notion page: https://julscampa.notion.site/IaC-with-Terraform-Demo-266a1fb53460429f84e41551c598790d
